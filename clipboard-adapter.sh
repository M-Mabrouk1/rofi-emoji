# Clipboard adapter for rofi-emoji.
#
# Usage:
#   clipboard-adapter.sh copy "emoji"
#     Set clipboard to "emoji".
#     Example: clipboard-adapter.sh copy "üòÅ"
#
#   clipboard-adapter.sh insert "emoji" "codepoints"
#     Tries to insert the emoji in the focused application like a keypress. If
#     insertion is not enabled, then copy instead.
#     Example: clipboard-adapter.sh insert "üòÅ" "U1F601"
#
# Detects Wayland and X and finds the appropriate tool for the current
# environment.
#
# If stderr is bound to /dev/null, then error messages will be emitted as
# notifications using `notify-send` (if available).
# When rofi is run from a terminal, the output both on stderr and stdout should
# be visible to the user and makes it possible to do some debugging.
